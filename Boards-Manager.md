The "**Preferences**" dialog will open, then add the following link to the "*Additional Boards Managers URLs*" field:

https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/master/STM32/package_stm_index.json

Click "**Ok**"

2- Click on "**Tools**" menu and then "**Boards > Boards Manager**"

Now you can find the new board in the "**Board**" menu. 

### Troubleshooting

If you have any issue to download a package, ensure to not be behind a proxy.

Else configure the proxy in the Arduino.cc IDE (open the "**Preferences**" dialog and select "**Network**" tab).
