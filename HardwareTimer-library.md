[[/img/Warning-icon.png|alt="Warning"]] Needs *Arduino_Core_STM32* version > 1.6.1

##  1. <a name='Introduction'></a>Introduction

The HardwareTimer library aims to provide access to part of STM32 hardware Timer feature (If other features are required, they could be accessed through [STM32Cube](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/stm32cube-ecosystem.html) HAL/LL).

The use of this library suppose you have some basic knowledge of STM32 hardware timer architecture. 
First of all remind that all timers are not equivalent and doesn't support the same features. Please refer to the Reference Manual of your MCU. 

__Example__:
* `TIM6` and `TIM7` doesn't have outpin and this is the reason why, when available, they are used to implement Tone and Servo.
* Some timers have up to 4 output channels with 4 complementary channels
    whereas other timers have no complementary, or have only 1 or 2 channels...

Each timer may provide several channels, nevertheless it is important to understand that all channels of the same timer share the same counter and thus have the same period/frequency.

[[/img/Warning-icon.png|alt="Warning"]] __For genericity purpose, HardwareTimer library uses all timers like a 16bits timer (even if some may be wider).__

##  3. <a name='Usage'></a>Usage

`HardwareTimer` is a C++ class, 1st thing to do is to instantiate an object with `TIM` instance as parameter.

[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] Some instances are used by Servo, Tone and SoftSerial (see TIMER_SERVO, TIMER_TONE and TIMER_SERIAL) but only when they are used. Just be sure there is no conflict with your own usage.

__Example__:
```C++
    HardwareTimer *MyTim = new HardwareTimer(TIM3);  // TIM3 is MCU hardware peripheral instance, its definition is provided in CMSIS
```

Then it is possible to configure mode of a channel.

[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] No need to configure pin mode (output/input/AlternateFunction), it will be done automatically by HardwareTimer library.

[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] Channel range [1..4], but not all timers support 4 channels.

__Example__: 
```C++
    MyTim->setMode(channel, TIMER_OUTPUT_COMPARE_PWM1, pin);
```

Supported Mode:
```C
typedef enum {
  TIMER_DISABLED,                         // == TIM_OCMODE_TIMING           no output, useful for only-interrupt
  // Output Compare
  TIMER_OUTPUT_COMPARE,                   // == Obsolete, use TIMER_DISABLED instead. Kept for compatibility reason
  TIMER_OUTPUT_COMPARE_ACTIVE,            // == TIM_OCMODE_ACTIVE           pin is set high when counter == channel compare
  TIMER_OUTPUT_COMPARE_INACTIVE,          // == TIM_OCMODE_INACTIVE         pin is set low when counter == channel compare
  TIMER_OUTPUT_COMPARE_TOGGLE,            // == TIM_OCMODE_TOGGLE           pin toggles when counter == channel compare
  TIMER_OUTPUT_COMPARE_PWM1,              // == TIM_OCMODE_PWM1             pin high when counter < channel compare, low otherwise
  TIMER_OUTPUT_COMPARE_PWM2,              // == TIM_OCMODE_PWM2             pin low when counter < channel compare, high otherwise
  TIMER_OUTPUT_COMPARE_FORCED_ACTIVE,     // == TIM_OCMODE_FORCED_ACTIVE    pin always high
  TIMER_OUTPUT_COMPARE_FORCED_INACTIVE,   // == TIM_OCMODE_FORCED_INACTIVE  pin always low

  //Input capture
  TIMER_INPUT_CAPTURE_RISING,             // == TIM_INPUTCHANNELPOLARITY_RISING
  TIMER_INPUT_CAPTURE_FALLING,            // == TIM_INPUTCHANNELPOLARITY_FALLING
  TIMER_INPUT_CAPTURE_BOTHEDGE,           // == TIM_INPUTCHANNELPOLARITY_BOTHEDGE

  // Used 2 channels for a single pin. One channel in TIM_INPUTCHANNELPOLARITY_RISING another channel in TIM_INPUTCHANNELPOLARITY_FALLING.
  // Channels must be used by pair: CH1 with CH2, or CH3 with CH4
  // This mode is very useful for Frequency and Dutycycle measurement
  TIMER_INPUT_FREQ_DUTY_MEASUREMENT,

  TIMER_NOT_USED = 0xFFFF  // This must be the last item of this enum
} TimerModes_t;
```

Then it is possible to configure *PrescalerFactor*. The Timer clock will be divided by this factor (if timer clock is 10Khz, and prescaler factor is 2, then timer will count at 5kHz).


[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] Configuration of *prescaler* is automatic when using method `setOverflow` with `format == MICROSEC_FORMAT` or `format == HERTZ_FORMAT`.

[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] *Prescaler* is for timer counter and thus is common to all channel.

[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] *PrescalerFactor* range: [1.. 0x10000]  (Hardware register will range [0..0xFFFF]).

__Example__:
```C++
    MyTim->setPrescaleFactor(8);
```

Then it is possible to configure *overflow* (also called rollover or update).

For __output__ it correspond to period or frequency.

For __input capture__ it is suggested to use max value: 0x10000 to avoid rollover before capture occurs .

[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] Configuration of *prescaler* is automatic when using method `setOverflow` with `format == MICROSEC_FORMAT` or `format == HERTZ_FORMAT`.

[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] *overflow* is common to all channel.

[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] *Overflow* range: [1.. 0x10000] (Hardware register will range [0..0xFFFF]).

__Example__:
```C++
     MyTim->setOverflow(10000); // Default format is TICK_FORMAT. Rollover will occurs when timer counter counts 10000 ticks (it reach it count from 0 to 9999)
     MyTim->setOverflow(10000, TICK_FORMAT);
     MyTim->setOverflow(10000, MICROSEC_FORMAT); // 10000 microseconds
     MyTim->setOverflow(10000, HERTZ_FORMAT); // 10 kHz
```

Then it is possible to configure *CaptureCompare* (channel specific CaptureCompare register).

[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] *CaptureCompare* is for one channel only.

[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] *CaptureCompare* range: [0.. 0xFFFF]

__Example__:
```C++
    MyTim->setCaptureCompare(channel, 50); // Default format is TICK_FORMAT. 50 ticks
    MyTim->setCaptureCompare(channel, 50, TICK_FORMAT)
    MyTim->setCaptureCompare(channel, 50, MICROSEC_COMPARE_FORMAT); // 50 microseconds    between counter reset and compare
    MyTim->setCaptureCompare(channel, 50, HERTZ_COMPARE_FORMAT); // 50 Hertz -> 1/50    seconds between counter reset and compare
    MyTim->setCaptureCompare(channel, 50, RESOLUTION_8B_COMPARE_FORMAT); // used for    Dutycycle: [0.. 255]
    MyTim->setCaptureCompare(channel, 50, RESOLUTION_12B_COMPARE_FORMAT); // used for   Dutycycle: [0.. 4095]
```

It is possible to attach a user callback on update interrupt (rollover) and/or on Capture/Compare interrupt.
If no channel is specified, the user callback is attach to update event.
Note that the Update Interrupt Flag (UIF) is set when an update event occurs and generates an interrupt, and is automatically cleared by the HAL driver **before** the user callback is executed. There is no need for the user callback to clear the UIF explicitly.

__Example__:
```C++
    MyTim->attachInterrupt(Update_IT_callback); // Userdefined call back. See 'Examples' chapter to see how to use callback with or without parameter
    MyTim->attachInterrupt(channel, Compare_IT_callback); // Userdefined call back. See 'Examples' chapter to see how to use callback with or without parameter
```

It is now time to start timer.

[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] All channel of the same timer are started at the same time (as there is only 1 counter per timer).

__Example__:
```C++
    MyTim->resume();
```

Timer can be paused then resumed
```C++
    MyTim->pause();
    ...
    MyTim->resume();
```

Below is an example of full PWM configuration.

__Example__:
```C++
    MyTim->setMode(channel, TIMER_OUTPUT_COMPARE_PWM1, pin);
    // MyTim->setPrescaleFactor(8); // Due to setOverflow with MICROSEC_FORMAT, prescaler   will be computed automatically based on timer input clock
    MyTim->setOverflow(100000, MICROSEC_FORMAT); // 10000 microseconds = 10 milliseconds
    MyTim->setCaptureCompare(channel, 50, PERCENT_COMPARE_FORMAT); // 50%
    MyTim->attachInterrupt(Update_IT_callback);
    MyTim->attachInterrupt(channel, Compare_IT_callback);
    MyTim->resume();
```

To simplify basic PWM configuration, a dedicated all-in-one API is provided.
Overflow/frequency is in hertz, dutycycle in percentage.

__Example__:
```C++
    MyTim->setPWM(channel, pin, 5, 10, NULL, NULL); // No callback required, we can   simplify the function call
    MyTim->setPWM(channel, pin, 5, 10); // 5 Hertz, 10% dutycycle
```

Some additional APIs allow to retrieve configurations:
```C++
    getPrescaleFactor();
    getOverflow();
    getCaptureCompare(); // In InputCapture mode, this method doesn't retrieve configuration   but retrieve the captured counter value
    getCount();
```

Also, to get ride of Interrupt callback:
```C++
    detachInterrupt()
```
[[/img/Note-icon.png|alt="Note"]] Once the timer is started with the callback enabled you can disable and enable the callback through `detachInterrupt` and `attachInterrupt` freely, how many times you want. However, if the first `resume` (= timer start) is done without **before** calling `attachInterrupt`, the HardwareTimer will **not** be able to attach the interrupt later (for performance reasons the timer will be started with interrupts disabled)

If you detach and attach interrupts while the timer is running, starting from version 1.8.0, you can also know if there's a callback already attached (without the need to track it externally) through the method
```C++
    hasInterrupt()
```

##  4. <a name='Examples'></a>Examples
Following examples are provided in [STM32Examples](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32Examples) library (available with Arduino Library manager):

   * [Timebase_callback.ino](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32Examples/blob/main/examples/Peripherals/HardwareTimer/Timebase_callback/Timebase_callback.ino)

        This example shows how to configure HardwareTimer to execute a callback at regular interval.
        Callback toggles pin.
        Once configured, there is only CPU load for callbacks executions.

   * [Timebase_callback_with_parameter.ino](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32Examples/blob/main/examples/Peripherals/HardwareTimer/Timebase_callback_with_parameter/Timebase_callback_with_parameter.ino)

        This example shows how to configure HardwareTimer to execute a callback with parameter at regular interval.
        Callback toggles pin.
        Once configured, there is only CPU load for callbacks executions.

   * [PWM_FullConfiguration.ino](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32Examples/blob/main/examples/Peripherals/HardwareTimer/PWM_FullConfiguration/PWM_FullConfiguration.ino)

        This example shows how to fully configure a PWM with HardwareTimer.
        PWM is generated on `LED_BUILTIN` if available.
        PWM is generated by hardware: no CPU load.
        Nevertheless, in this example both interruption callback are used on Compare match (Falling edge of PWM1 mode) and update event (rising edge of PWM1 mode).
        Those call back are used to toggle a second pin: `pin2`.
        Once configured, there is only CPU load for callbacks executions.

   * [All-in-one_setPWM.ino](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32Examples/blob/main/examples/Peripherals/HardwareTimer/All-in-one_setPWM/All-in-one_setPWM.ino)

        This example shows how to configure a PWM with HardwareTimer in one single function call.
        PWM is generated on `LED_BUILTIN` if available.
        No interruption callback used: PWM is generated by hardware.
        Once configured, there is no CPU load.

   * [InputCapture.ino](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32Examples/blob/main/examples/Peripherals/HardwareTimer/InputCapture/InputCapture.ino)

        This example shows how to configure HardwareTimer in inputcapture to measure external signal frequency.
        Each time a rising edge is detected on the input pin, hardware will save counter value into CaptureCompare register.
        External signal (signal generator for example) should be connected to `D2`.
        Measured frequency is displayed on Serial Monitor.

   * [Frequency_Dutycycle_measurement.ino](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32Examples/blob/main/examples/Peripherals/HardwareTimer/Frequency_Dutycycle_measurement/Frequency_Dutycycle_measurement.ino)

        This example shows how to configure HardwareTimer to measure external signal frequency and dutycycle.
        The input pin will be connected to 2 channel of the timer, one for rising edge the other for falling edge.
        Each time a rising edge is detected on the input pin, hardware will save counter value into one of the CaptureCompare register.
        Each time a falling edge is detected on the input pin, hardware will save counter value into the other CaptureCompare register.
        External signal (signal generator for example) should be connected to `D2`.

##  5. <a name='Dependencies'></a>Dependencies
[[/img/Warning-icon.png|alt="Warning"]] Needs *Arduino_Core_STM32* version > 1.6.1

*Tone*, *Servo* and *analogwrite* have been updated to use *HardwareTimer*.

New optional parameter *destruct* has been added to *noTone* to decide whether to destruct/free HardwareTimer object.
```C++
noTone(uint8_t _pin, bool destruct = false)
```
##  6. <a name= Restriction ></a> Restriction
There is a special case where period is set to its maximum value 0xFFFF and 100% duty cycle is requested.
It is not possible to achieve this from hardware point of view (except changing mode to `TIMER_OUTPUT_COMPARE_FORCED_ACTIVE`).
In this specific case there will be 1 tick (the last one) which will be LOW. Then we lose only 1 tick out of 65535 => 99,998..%
